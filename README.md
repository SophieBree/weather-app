# Weather App

## Main Points
This is an independent project I made to test my ability to access data from an API and display it to the user on a webpage.
It was also a good opportunity to test my knowledge of React, and how to store API keys securely using Netlify functions.
The project features detailed weather reports about the current and forecasted weather conditions from any location in Australia.

The app itself is quite simple from a user's perspective - you simply type in the name of a town/city, click the button, and the data appears. However, there were some issues I ran into while developing.

## Challenges
The main challenge I had was learning how to securely store the API key for grabbing the weather data without using my own backend. I searched and found out that a good way to do this was by utilising Netlify functions, so I paired up with another developer I know and we worked on implementing that into the app. After some bugs were ironed out in the process, it was successful and the API key is now hidden securely.
